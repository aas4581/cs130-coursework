Accesibilty Reflection

For some reason the WAVE tool is not working on my website.


Corrections - Aria Labels, alt text for the images, contrast errors betweeen text and background

I think website will not be useable without CSS. Things will be overlapping. UPDATE: I tried and it still works, the iterface is just a bit clunky and you have to scroll for a bit to reach the player.

The site is tabbable.
